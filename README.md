# Heart Dataset Analysis
## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze the Heart dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The following tasks were addressed to derive insights and visualizations:
1. Calculate basic statistical measures (minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode, and standard deviation) of age.
2. Determine the count of males and females in the dataset.
3. Explore relationships between features using heatmaps.
4. Visualize the correlation of data attributes with a heatmap.
5. Count the number of individuals affected and not affected by heart disease.
6. Create a bar chart showing the distribution of individuals affected and not affected by heart disease.
7. Calculate the percentage distribution of different chest pain types.
8. Visualize the gender distribution in the dataset using charts.
9. Show the distribution of heart disease cases among males and females.
10. Identify the age group most affected by heart disease.
11. Illustrate the distribution of chest pain types in Heart Disease vs. Non-Heart Disease categories.
12. Display the distribution of resting blood pressure (trestbps) using graphs.
13. Show the serum cholesterol (chol) data distribution using graphs.
14. Examine the distribution of resting blood pressure among patients.
15. Create a scatter plot for cholesterol vs. age.

## Analysis and Visualizations
### 1. Age Statistics
+ Minimum Age: Calculated using the min() function.
+ Maximum Age: Calculated using the max() function.
+ Mean Age: Calculated using the mean() function.
+ Median Age: Determined with the median() function.
+ Mode Age: Obtained using the mode() function.
+ Standard Deviation: Derived using the std() function.
### 2. Gender Distribution
+ Counted the number of males and females in the dataset using the value_counts() function on the gender column.
### 3. Data Correlation
+ Generated a correlation matrix using the corr() method.
+ Visualized the correlation using a heatmap with Seaborn.
### 4. Heart Disease Status
+ Identified the number of individuals affected and not affected by heart disease.
+ Created a bar chart to represent the distribution of heart disease status using Matplotlib.
### 5. Chest Pain Type Distribution
+ Calculated the percentage distribution of different chest pain types.
+ Visualized the distribution using a pie chart or bar graph.
### 6. Gender Distribution
+ Illustrated the gender distribution with pie charts or bar graphs.
### 7. Distribution of Heart Disease Among Genders
+ Segmented heart disease cases by gender.
+ Created a grouped bar chart for visualization.
### 8. Most Affected Age Group
+ Categorized ages into bins and identified the most affected age group.
+ Displayed findings with a histogram or bar chart.
### 9. Chest Pain Distribution in Heart Disease
+ Analyzed the distribution of chest pain types among individuals with and without heart disease.
+ Used bar graphs or grouped bar charts for representation.
### 10. Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps) Distribution
+ Visualized the distribution of resting blood pressure values using histograms or density plots.
### 11. Serum Cholesterol (chol) Distribution
+ Displayed the serum cholesterol distribution with histograms or boxplots.
### 12. Resting Blood Pressure Among Patients
+ Analyzed the distribution of resting blood pressure values with descriptive statistics and graphs.
### 13. Scatter Plot: Cholesterol vs. Age
+ Created a scatter plot with age on the x-axis and cholesterol on the y-axis to identify patterns or trends.
## Conclusion
The analysis of the Heart dataset provided critical insights into various aspects of heart disease, including demographic and physiological factors. Key findings include:
+ Demographic Trends: (e.g., The majority of patients with heart conditions were in the age group of 40â€“60 years. Men were more affected than women in this dataset.)
+ Health Metrics: (e.g., High cholesterol levels and blood pressure were observed as common factors among patients with heart conditions.)
+ Relationships: (e.g., A positive correlation was found between age and cholesterol levels, indicating an increased risk with age.)
+ Risk Factors: (e.g., Diabetes, and obesity were significant contributors to heart disease in the dataset.)

These insights can guide further research and potential preventative measures in the medical field. The visualizations effectively communicate complex data trends and support informed decision-making.
